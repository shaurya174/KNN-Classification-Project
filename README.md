### 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project (Jupyter Notebook)

This Jupyter notebook explores the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification technique using the **Scikit-Learn** library. It covers:

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling using `StandardScaler` for effective KNN performance.
- 🧠 **Model Building:** Creating and training a KNN classifier.
- 🔧 **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model accuracy, analyzing error rates, and optimizing the value of K.
- 📈 **Visualization:** Error rate vs. K value plot for effective K selection.
